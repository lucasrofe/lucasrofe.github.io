# Lucas Rocha Ferreira

PhD Student in Genetics & Statistical Genomics  
CEA (French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission), Île-de-France, France 🇫🇷

## About Me 👋

I’m a PhD student studying the **association genomics of *Tenebrio molitor*** (the yellow mealworm), with a particular focus on traits related to **growth, reproduction, and fertility**. My research involves **Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS)** and **genomic prediction**. I'm currently based at **CEA Fontenay-aux-Roses**, a leading French research institution near Paris.

Although my work involves using bioinformatics tools, my main focus lies in **quantiative genetics,statistical genetics and animal genetics**, particularly in exploring the genetic architecture of agronomic traits in an edible insect.

## Current Work ☝🤓
My PhD research is currently in progress. I have presented preliminary results at several conferences and continue to develop methodologies for association studies in my field.  As my research advances, I look forward on sharing more as it evolves.

## Personal Interests 🌟

I'm passionate about continuous learning and curiosity-driven research. When I’m not working, I enjoy:
- Discovering new pâtisseries or salons de thé around Paris 🍰
- Going for the occasional jog 🏃‍♂️  
- Listening to music 🎶  
- Practicing **Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu** 🥋🇧🇷   
- Getting lost in YouTube rabbit holes 📱
- Collecting books (and occasionally even reading them!) 📚

## What to Expect Here 📝

This site is my digital notebook and academic corner. You’ll find:

🧪 **Projects**: As my PhD progresses, I’ll share results, visualizations, and summaries of key findings.

✍️ **Blog Posts**: Lessons learned, reflections, and tutorials on:
- Challenges of learning as a junior researcher (especially in the AI bubble) 🤖
- Communication in academia — it's more complex than it seems! Some lessons were learned the hard way. 😅
- Practical guides in statistical genetics and GWAS
