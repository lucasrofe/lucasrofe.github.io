This could be a tutorial or a guide.

When doing genetic analysis, you'll eventually have to do a LD analysis. [explain briefly the definition of what it is: something about knowing how the genetic variants are correlated to each other].
Why? [explain the principle, and purpose of LD]

One of the things you can do is estimate pairwise LD calculation.
Why? for what?

Eventually, you'll have to specify parameters for you pairwise LD calculation.
Why? Couldn't we just let if for default? No since every data is different, and organism is different, and strain is different, etc.

How do you select the right parameters for your data?
Through testing first I suppose, then adjust.
