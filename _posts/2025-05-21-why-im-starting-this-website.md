title: "Why I’m Starting This Website"

Lately, I've been noticing something: **everyone seems to have a website**.

Especially in academia — PhD students, postdocs, researchers — many of them are building personal sites where they share tutorials, document side projects, and showcase their work. I see people post them on LinkedIn with pride, and I have to admit… it sparked something in me. Not exactly jealousy, but a kind of formal **FOMO** — fear of missing out. Like maybe I should be doing this too.

So here I am. Starting something.  

Right now, I don’t feel like I have anything groundbreaking to publish. During my Master’s I worked on several projects (some DNA sequence alignment, for example), but they don’t really reflect what I’m interested in today. I’m not passionate about posting those.

This space is more of a blank canvas for me. A fresh start.  
A place where I can:

- Explore new ideas, even unrelated to my core PhD topic  
- Document things I learn along the way  
- Share thoughts, struggles, wins — academic or not  

I want this site to grow with me. I might share a cool bioinformatics pipeline, a data viz experiment, or even write about tools and habits that help me survive PhD life.

For now, I’m just excited.  
This is the beginning of something.
